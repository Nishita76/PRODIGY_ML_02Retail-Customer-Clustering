# Retail-Customer-Clustering 
## Project Overview
This project uses the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify different customer groups that can be targeted with tailored marketing strategies. Customer segmentation is a powerful technique that allows businesses to group their customers into distinct clusters, enabling targeted marketing strategies, personalized offers, and improved customer satisfaction.
